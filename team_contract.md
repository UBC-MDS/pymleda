Team Contract of Group 10
=========================
 Date: 2021-25-02


This document outlines the expectations discussed and agreed upon by the team members of group 10 for the DSCI 524 UBC MDS course. It is subject to change as the team decides it is needed.

### Team Members

- Saule Atymtayeva
- Sang Yoon Lee
- Yazan Saleh
- Tanmay Sharma


### Team Meetings

The team will meet:

- on Tuesdays at 5 pm (to outline every members' role for the upcoming week and an initial discussion of what needs to be done for the milestone)
- on Thursdays at 2 pm (as part of our scheduled lab time)
- Friday mornings at 10 am (to finalize and combine our individual components of the project)

All times are Pacific Standard Time.


### Communication Channels

The team will use the following communication channels:

- Github (for important matters that require direct project collaboration, recording the milestone main goals, and assigning them to the team members)
- Slack (for minor matters and quick communication)
- Zoom (for online meetings)


### Working On GitHub

At the start of each week, there will be a milestone branch created. Then, every subsequent branch will be created from this milestone branch by individual team members.

All commits on GitHub will be reviewed by at least one member of the team before being merged into the milestone branch. A team member created a pull request (PR) will not be allowed to merge their own PR into the main branch.

Team members are expected to pull from the main or milestone branch every time before working on their next piece of the project.


### Conflicts

Any conflict within the team will be attempted to be resolved peacefully by the team members. If the issue cannot be resolved with the help of all the team members, then the issue will be taken to the course instructor or to the UBC MDS directors for a resolution.


### Milestone Weekly Submissions

- Milestone 1 will be submitted by Yazan SALEH
- Milestone 2 will be submitted by Sang Yoon Lee
- Milestone 3 will be submitted by Saule Atymtayeva
- Milestone 4 will be submitted by Tanmay Sharma
