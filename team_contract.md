Team Contract of Group 10
=========================
 Date: 2021-25-02


This document outlines the expectations discussed and agreed upon by the team members of group 10 for the DSCI 524 UBC MDS course. It is subject to change as the team decides it is needed.

### Team Members

- Saule Atymtayeva
- Sang Yoon Lee
- Yazan Saleh
- Tanmay Sharma


### Team Meetings

The team will meet:

- on Tuesdays at 5 pm to outline every members' role for the upcoming week and an initial discussion of what needs to be done for the milestone.
- on Thursdays at 2 pm as part of our scheduled lab time.
- Friday mornings at 10 am to finalize and combine our individual components of the project.

All times are Pacific Standard Time.


### Communication Channels

The preferred methods of communication will be Slack for minor items and quick communication. Github will be used for more important matters that require direct project collaboration. Github will also serve to record the milestone main goals and assign them to the team members. Team meetings will take place over Zoom calls.

### Working On GitHub

There will be a milestone branch created at the start of each week. Every subsequent branch will then be created from that milestone branch by individual team members. All commits on GitHub will be reviewed by at least one member of the team before being merged to the milestone branch. A team member created a pull request (PR) is not allowed to merge their own PR into the main branch.

Team members are expected to pull from the main or milestone branch every time before working on their next piece of the project. Team members should also test and review their code and documents before submitting a pull request.


### Conflicts

If one or more members of the team are experiencing a conflict, they will attempt to talk it out together to see if they can come to a reasonable and peaceful resolution. If the issue cannot be resolved with the help of all the team members, then the issue will be taken to the course instructor or to the MDS directors for a resolution.


### Milestone Weekly Submissions

- Milestone 1 will be submitted by Yazan SALEH
- Milestone 2 will be submitted by Sang Yoon Lee
- Milestone 3 will be submitted by Saule Atymtayeva
- Milestone 4 will be submitted by Tanmay Sharma
